  "Hello World. I am Yu (朱瑜). A Frontend Developer, Lifelong Learner,\nMusic Lover.",
  "I love coding. Over the years I have never stopped learning new\ntechnologies and strengthening my basic knowledge. I've always\nrequired myself to meet the standards of a Software engineer. In the\nsoftware development process, I try to make my code as simple and\neasy to read, modular, reusable, extendable, and maintainable as\npossible. I hope when the next engineer sees my code, he or she will\nbe able to get started quickly and continue developing new features.\nI believe that a willingness to help people, combined with\ntechnology, can make the world a better place.",
  "I love UX-Design. As a Frontend Developer, my primary responsibility\nis, to understand the needs of the user, then rendering the\ninformation as friendly as possible. I like Minimalist Design and\nfriendly Interaction. I'd love to think about how users would use\nthe software in different scenarios. I'm passionate about new\ntechnologies, but I also believe that technology is not the goal in\nitself, but a means to achieve the goal. I'd love to develop\nsoftware that helps users achieve their goals efficiently and\nsatisfactorily.",
  "I love challenges. I have been working in Germany since 2015. In the\nmeantime, I studied German. Now as a Frontend Developer, working in\nthe Automotive Industry.

So far, I have participated in the development\nof various features for several vehicle models, such as media\nplayer, navigation, seat massage, phone, etc.",
