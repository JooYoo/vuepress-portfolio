  "Hello World. I am Yu (朱瑜). A Frontend Developer, Lifelong Learner, Music Lover.",
  "I love coding. Over the years I have never stopped learning new technologies and strengthening my basic knowledge. I've always required myself to meet the standards of a Software engineer. In the software development process, I try to make my code as simple and easy to read, modular, reusable, extendable, and maintainable as possible. I hope when the next engineer sees my code, he or she will be able to get started quickly and continue developing new features. I believe that a willingness to help people, combined with technology, can make the world a better place.",
  "I love UX-Design. As a Frontend Developer, my primary responsibility is, to understand the needs of the user, then rendering the information as friendly as possible. I like Minimalist Design and friendly Interaction. I'd love to think about how users would use the software in different scenarios. I'm passionate about new technologies, but I also believe that technology is not the goal in itself, but a means to achieve the goal. I'd love to develop software that helps users achieve their goals efficiently and satisfactorily.",
  "I love challenges. I have been working in Germany since 2015. In the meantime, I studied German. Now as a Frontend Developer, working in the Automotive Industry.
