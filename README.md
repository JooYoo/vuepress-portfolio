# User story

As a developer, I want to have a platform to introduce myself and showcase the projects I created, so that I have a better chance to find a job; as a lifelong learner, I want to have a space to summarise the knowledge I've learned, and share with the world so that I can get more from the study and perhaps also help the people who is trying to learn the same topic like me.
